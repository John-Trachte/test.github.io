    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Platteville.
        I will be graduating with these degrees, as well as a Spanish minor, in December of 2026.</p>
    <p>I love seeing the results of my code in the real world, from interactions with embedded
        microcontroller registers to custom API development and database communication.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>john-trachte.github.io</h2>
    <p>This very website is under construction! It is being built with custom HTML and CSS and deployed on Github
        Pages. I'm aiming to have it visually done by August first of this year,
        and populated with exciting projects by late September.</p>
    <h2>Attendance App</h2>
    <p>A group project for my Intermediate Software Engineering course, I got experience with Agile (Scrum)
        software development, Python/BASH integration, and RESTful API calls, all supporting my own
        SOLID-based object-oriented design.</p>

    <!-- <h1>What I'm Learning</h1>
            <h2>FPGA & Verilog</h2>
            <p>Basic Verilog and FPGA concepts on the Sipeed Tang Nano 9k with the help of nandland.com.</p>
            <h2>Networking</h2>
            <p>More in-depth CCNA concept coverage to improve my understanding from school, guided by Network
                Chuck's Free CCNA playlist on YouTube.</p>
            <h2>OOP and CPP Refresher</h2>
            <p>Some of my programming basics need a little more work as I have used them less and less in more
                abstract courses. I'll be writing projects in C/C++ with a strong focus on best practices and object
                oriented principles like SOLID where possible.</p> -->
