    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <h4>Education & Interests</h4>
    <p>I am Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin - Platteville.
        I will be graduating with these degrees, as well as a Spanish minor, in May of 2027.</p>
    <p>I love seeing the results of my code in the real world, from interactions with embedded
        microcontroller registers to custom API development and database communication.</p>
    <p>My professional and hobby interests include motion control/control systems, embedded systems, and metrology.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <hr>
    <h4>Auto PCB</h4>
    <p>In order to test out electrical designs, I'd like to be able to rapidly produce printed circuit boards -
        so, I'm using my software engineering and embedded systems skills to automate the process! This project
        integrates database design, API design, web design, and embedded software design, all in an easily deployable
        Docker image.
    </p>
    <h4>john-trachte.github.io</h4>
    <p>This very website is under construction! It is being built with custom HTML and CSS and deployed on Github
        Pages. I'm aiming to have it visually done by August first of this year,
        and populated with exciting projects by late September.</p>
    <h4>Attendance App</h4>
    <p>A group project for my Intermediate Software Engineering course, I got experience with Agile (Scrum)
        software development, Python/BASH integration, and RESTful API calls, all supporting my own
        SOLID-based object-oriented design.</p>
